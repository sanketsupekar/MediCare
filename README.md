# Medicare - A Centralized System
## Introduction
MediCare 
  Aims to give different kinds of specialist treatments by simply visiting and booking the 
appointments online on the website. This system is based on paperless and partially on 
contactless approach as well. It covers all the required modules right from Patient and Doctor 
Registration/Login, User profiles, Hospital Admin, Patient appointment.
### Hospital: 
  Hospital is the centred controller of the whole project. The Hospital admin has the 
whole rights to add or delete the doctor and monitor the whole working of the MediCare site.
### Patient: 
  The patient after a successful login can edit his profile by redirecting from the 
navbar, he can update his profile details, further for booking an appointment for a specific 
doctor or patient he can explore them and as per his need can schedule the appointment and 
check status.
### Doctor: 
  The doctor after he successfully loges in can view his profile and edit it according to 
his needs. He can view the schedules daily appointments on his dashboard by redirecting to 
the appointment section from the navbar. He has the rights to accept or reject the appointment 
accordingly.
The overall flow of the project is Login/Registration then Profile View as per the user logged 
in, Profile updating, Appointment Schedule, Book Appointment and View status
